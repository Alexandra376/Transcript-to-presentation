Slide 1:
(Title: Big O Notation)
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen! Today, we will delve into an essential topic in computer science - "Big O Notation." This notation plays a pivotal role in analyzing algorithm efficiency. It helps us compare the performance of different algorithms and predict how they will behave with large data sets. Let's embark on this journey of understanding Big O Notation and its significance in the world of computer science.

Slide 2:
(Title: What is Big O Notation?)
Big O Notation is a mathematical notation that allows us to evaluate the rate of growth in the runtime of an algorithm or its complexity as the input size increases. In simple terms, it enables us to compare the efficiency of different algorithms and predict how they will perform with large data sets. For example, an algorithm with O(1) complexity will always take the same amount of time to execute, regardless of the input size. In contrast, an algorithm with O(n) complexity will take time linearly proportional to the input size. Big O Notation serves as a standardized metric to gauge algorithmic efficiency and aids in making informed decisions when designing algorithms for real-world applications.

Slide 3:
(Title: Why do we need Big O Notation?)
You might wonder, "Why do we need this Big O Notation?" Well, it has several crucial advantages:
1. Firstly, it helps us select the most optimal algorithm to solve a specific problem, enhancing the performance of our programs. By analyzing the Big O complexity of different algorithms, we can identify the most efficient one for a given task.
2. Secondly, it allows us to predict how the runtime of an algorithm will change as the input size increases. This predictive power is invaluable for estimating how our programs will scale with larger data sets and ensuring that they can handle real-world workloads efficiently.
3. Lastly, it improves our understanding of algorithm efficiency and aids in developing sophisticated software solutions. By appreciating the impact of algorithmic complexity on the overall performance, we can make better design choices and optimize our code for faster execution.

Slide 4:
(Title: Examples of Big O Notation)
Let's explore some examples of Big O Notation for better comprehension. Understanding these examples will illustrate how different algorithms behave in terms of their complexity and help us make informed decisions while designing software.

Slide 5: 
Slide 5 shows a real application of Big o Notation - time Complexity or 
rather, the use of Constant Notation: O(1) and Linear Notation: O(N).

Slide 6:
(Title: Example 1 - O(1)) 

I propose to consider types of Time complexity Cases more detail on slides 7, 8 and 9 .

Our first example is O(1), which means constant time complexity. This implies that the algorithm's runtime remains unaffected by the input size. A classic example is accessing an element in an array using its index. Regardless of the array's size, the access time remains constant. For instance, an algorithm to retrieve the first value of a data set, will always be completed in one step, regardless of the number of values in the data set. A hashing algorithm is an O(1) algorithm that can be used to very effectively locate/search a value/key when the data is stored using a hash table. It’s a more effective way than using a linear search O(N) or binary search O(Log(N)) algorithm.

Slide 7:
Title: Example 3 - O(n)) +
Moving on to O(n), which represents linear complexity. The algorithm's runtime is directly proportional to the input size. An example is searching for an element in an unsorted array. We have to traverse each element in the array to find the target. Linear algorithms are straightforward but may not scale efficiently with significantly larger data sets. Algorithms, such as the linear search, which are based on a single loop to iterate through each value of the data set are more likely to have a linear notation O(N) though this is not always the case.

Slide 8:
(Title: Example 2 - O(log n)) +
Lastly, we have O(log n), corresponding to logarithmic complexity. The algorithm's runtime grows logarithmically with an increase in the input size. A binary search is a typical example of logarithmic algorithm. In a binary search, half of the data set is discarded after each iteration. Which means that an algorithm which searches through 2,000,000 values will just need one more iteration than if the data set only contained 1,000,000 values.

Slide 9:
Let's observe binary search more detail. First of all, Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N). 
Conditions for when to apply Binary Search in a Data Structure:
•	The data structure must be sorted.
•	Access to any element of the data structure takes constant time.
Binary search is faster than linear search, especially for large arrays. More efficient than other searching algorithms with a similar time complexity, such as interpolation search or exponential search and Binary search is well-suited for searching large datasets that are stored in external memory, such as on a hard drive or in the cloud.

Slide 10:
(Title: Conclusion)
Big O Notation is a powerful tool for analyzing algorithm efficiency. Choosing the right algorithm can significantly impact program performance. Always consider Big O Notation in your software development endeavors. By understanding algorithmic complexity and its effect on runtime, you can make informed design choices and create more efficient and scalable solutions.
